🚀 CareerNexus AI
AI-Powered Career Guidance System

CareerNexus AI is an end-to-end AI-driven career guidance platform that helps students make data-backed career decisions, identify skill gaps, follow personalized learning paths, and prepare effectively for industry interviews using Generative AI.

This leads to poor career decisions and low placement readiness.
